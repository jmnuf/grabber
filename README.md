# grabber

Meant as a simple file content searcher to replace my usage of grep when on windows.
This project was re-started and slightly expanded on under the name [grop](https://github.com/jmnuf/grop) when I switched computers.
Only brought back up as I am cleaning my computer of stuff before installing arch linux on it.

Just letting this exist for personal historical purposes.
